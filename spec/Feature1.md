# Feature Spec #1

Goal of this feature: Setup the repository with a basic outline of the client side app in Typescript. The skeleton app should be able to run with minimal work and should be converted to Typescript.

1. Create the Github Repo
2. Create initial implementation of the client/website
3. Create the initial implementation of the server/node backend
4. Create an interaction between the two services with TDD
5. Setup an automated testing system to test each PR
6. Setup an automated deployment to deploy to netlify or a similar service and using Github actions.

With this...developers will be able to build upon this skeleton and have some of the basic code, tests and devops tools setup.
